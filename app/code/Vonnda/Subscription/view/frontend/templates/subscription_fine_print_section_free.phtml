<p>If you activate within six months of your order date and remain auto-enrolled in filter refills, you will receive a free 6-month filter pack. By signing up for auto-refills, you are agreeing to the automatic refill subscription for your filters.  Your auto-refills will renew every six months, charging your credit card the full amount upon renewal every six months until canceled. Note: Additional sales tax may apply. Changes to your auto-refill schedule must be made at least 15 days prior to your renewal date to avoid billing for the next renewal period. You can cancel or make changes to your auto-refill schedule in your account under "Options". If you decide to stop auto-refills, you will continue to receive any shipments still outstanding in your current renewal period but will not be billed for another renewal period.</p>
